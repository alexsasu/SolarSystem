# SolarSystem

## Application Description

Unity application developed at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Bucharest.

The app features a rough simulation of our solar system.

## References

Part of the application's functionality is based on the [Solar-System-Unity3D](https://github.com/PatwinchIR/Solar-System-Unity3D) and [planet-ring-mesh](https://github.com/boardtobits/planet-ring-mesh) repositories.

The planet detail info is from [Planetary Fact Sheet - Metric](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/). The texture files for the planets and the Sun are from [Solar Textures](https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/). The background picture is from GitHub user [off99555](https://github.com/off99555/Solar-System-Simulation/tree/master/Assets/SolarSystemAssets/Materials).

## Application Elements

The application has the following features:
* Solar system: Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth & Moon, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
* An interactive menu
* Sliders for changing the dimensions of the planets and the Sun
* Slider for speeding up or slowing down the planets' movement and the Sun's movement
* Navigation with the W, A, S, D keys, as well as the Up and Down arrow keys
